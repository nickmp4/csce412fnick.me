        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            Through spending the day in Marsellie and visiting CMA CGM, I was able to gain insightful knowledge about a real world application of cloud computing, while also experiencing a new city. 
            At CMA CGM, I learned about how the company came to be, how they've changed over time, and what their future goals are.
            Alongside this, they demonstrated some examples of how they utilize cloud computing, with one example being their smartship program.
            Being able to see a real world application of these concepts helped me establish a connection between what I've learned in class and the industry as a whole. 
            In the end, I believe that this industry talk helped further my understanding of cloud computing, and also helped me learn more about the country and its industry.
            Outside of the talk, I was able to experience some of what Marseille had to offer. 
            From the La Major cathedral, to the tacos I paid a bit too much for, this trip helped me get a better understanding of the country I've been living in for the past two weeks.
